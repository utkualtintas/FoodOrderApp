# FoodOrderApp
This is the second android app I developed after completing Google's user input course on Udacity. This single page app has buttons, checkboxes and editTexts to get a food order from the user. Then, using an intent, it creates an email message according to the user's input.
A video of the app can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8YNeYq-pXQ
